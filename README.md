##To do:
go to Inventor training session
draw preliminary sketches for remote 
create a use case
create GUI on MATLAB 
3D print that


#Current problems:
* Too many buttons
* Size of buttons
* Wording on buttons - HDMI, AUX

#Whatâ€™s necessary:
* Way to navigate channels - numbers, circular scrolling thing? (old iPod)
* Changing inputs - DVD, VCR, cable, etc.
* Menu, undo, settings
* Menu: adjust picture/audio/TV/Network settings, set up Closed Captioning, name TV Inputs, access Guided Setup, access User Manual
* Volume control
* On/off
* Guide/Info access (press once to display info)

#Ideas:
* Number on a separate sliding board
* Backlit circular scroll buttons
* Volume button, w/ circular scroll button
* Channels button, then scroll through channels on screen w/ circular scroll
* More tactile: swivel bar
* First you select what you want the bar to be for - volume and channel buttons
* Can also be used to scroll through menu
* Can be pressed down
